# BookInfo ASP.NET Core 2.1 MVC Web App
This web app was written to demonstrate key concepts in development of ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 web apps using Visual Studio 2017.
Each of the following branches represents a development stage:

1. Initial: This branch has place-holder views and controllers to minimally support them
2. DomainModel: Models and a "fake" repository were added as well as view and controller code to minimally test some of the models

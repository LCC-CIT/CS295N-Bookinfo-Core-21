# BookInfo ASP.NET Core 2 MVC Web App
This web app was written to demonstrate key concepts in development of ASP.NET Core MVC 2 web apps using Visual Studio 2017.
Each of the following branches represents a development stage:

1. Initial: This branch has place-holder views and controllers to minimally support them. (Updated to 2.2)
2. DomainModel: Models and a "fake" repository were added as well as view and controller code to minimally test some of the models
